# Git problems and solutions.
I´ve created this project on git and follow the normal procedures to sync with my legal local project.
But isn't the first time this happening git refuse my connection.
' git pull origin master  --allow-unrelated-histories ' was the solution.
Asking for another commit and after the push origin master it´s available.
